title: The Art of Combination
---

"The acme of strategic ability is displayed in
the provision of means for this great event (the battle),
in the skillful determination of place and time, and direction
of troops, and the good use made of success... all is here
rather simple, the art of combination by no means great;
but there is great need of quickness in judging of circumstances, need of energy,
steady resolution, a youthful spirit of enterprise -- heroic qualities.
_There is, therefore, but little wanted here of that which can be taught
by books and there is much that, if it can be taught at all, must come
to the General through some other medium than printer's type_.

The impulse towards a great battle, the voluntary, sure progress to it, must
proceed from a feeling of innate power and a clear sense of the necessity;
in other words, it must proceed from inborn courage and from perceptions
sharpened by contact with the higher interests of life."

-- _On War_, Carl von Clausewitz, Book IV. _The Combat_ Chapter XI.
